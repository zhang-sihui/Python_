The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
美丽胜于丑陋。
显式优于隐式。
简单胜于复杂。
复杂胜于繁复。
平面比嵌套更好。
稀疏胜于密集。
可读性很重要。
特殊情况不够特殊,不足以违反规则。
虽然实用性胜过纯洁。
错误不应无声地传递。
除非明确沉默。
面对模棱两可,拒绝猜测的诱惑。
应该有一种——最好只有一个——显而易见的方法。
虽然这种方式一开始可能并不明显,除非你是荷兰人。
现在总比没有好。
虽然现在从来没有比[右]更好。
如果实现很难解释,这是一个坏主意。
如果实现易于解释,这可能是个好主意。
命名空间是一个好主意 - 让我们做更多的这些!
中英文只能显示英文？？？？
